# Making a RESTAPIs for CRUD OPERATION.
STEP 1:
Starting the spring tool suite and using Spring Starter Project. Adding the required dependencies, in this project we have downloaded depencies are:

-Spring Web
for Starter web
-Spring Boot Dev Tools
for automatic updation the project, with running everytime mannually
-Spring Data JPA
for functionality to use Hibernate JPA Annotation
-MySQL Driver
for Connection of jdbc MySQL
-Lombok
for avoiding the boiler plate code like getters and setters

STEP 2: PACKAGING STRUCTURE
Organizing with proper packages of each respective classes  and interfaces

com.carscan is the base package.
-controller package for the details of UserContrller class.
-entity package for entity class like User class.
-repository package for UserRepositoy interface for acheiving the functionality of CRUD Operation or JPARepository.
-service package for UserService interface using for abstration class writing only method declaration.
-service.Impl package for method implementation which is already declare in service interface.

STEP 3: ENTITY 
Making entity class for User and its attributes which is given during assignment
fname, lname, dob, city and mobile number.
-Id is auto increment, Id annotation for database, without id can not save the data, we have to make id it could be integer or string data type
-using @Data annotation for avoiding the getters and setters
-we can use  @Column annotation for making column in database, if not then automatically makes column using given attribute like. fnam, lname...etc

STEP 4: SERVICE
In service interface we declare only method, for which method is going to be used for our requirements
-method for getting the list of User is:
returning the list of all users and passing the parameter User class and object
- method for saving the user, does not return any things then we have to use void  and passing the parameter User class and its object
-method for update user by id, we have to pass parameter  datatype and id for which we can find the details by id
-method for delete user by id, it is also not returning anything then we have to use void and passing parameter is id with datatype.

STEP 5: SERVICE IMPL
implementing the above method in service implementation class and use of repository class by autowired annotation to achieve jpa query properties.

STEP 6: CONTROLLER
Controller class is used to handle the request which is send by web or Postman,
- in controller we have to make method handler for app apis which is implemented in service implementation class for
- for returning the list of user,we have to use @Getmapping and given path like("/listusers"),  making method and passing the User class and its object and returning the same.
- for posting, we have to use @PostMapping annotation for sending the data and save, @Requestbody annotation for sending the User class and its objects
-for updating the details using the @pathvariable annotation to find the specific id details.
-same for the delete.
